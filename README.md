 Hi, I’m @BeaRohden. I'm 30 year old living in Brazil. Recently, I have decided to teach myself how to code for fun (and, who knows, maybe make it my job?).
I've been using free online resources like The Odin Project, FreeCodeCamp and youtube videos, as well as websides like W3 and MDN docs.

I’m currently learning Web Development wih HTML, CSS(bootstrap) and JavaScript.

Any help on how to improve my code are, as always, very welcomed.
